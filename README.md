Given images of white blood cells, classify them as MONONUCLEAR(NEUTROPHIL, EOSINOPHIL) OR POLYNUCLEAR(BASOPHIL, LYMPHOCYTE, MONOCYTE).

An important problem in blood diagnostics is classifying different types of blood cells. In this project, we will attempt to train a classifier to predict the type of a blood cell given a dyed picture of it.

White blood cells images and dataset are provided by Athelas.
